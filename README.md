# DOMUS 
The Digital Open Modular Urban System- a Blender asset pack for archaeological reconstructions 

DOMUS is a Research project created primarily by Noah Chapman under Carleton University's XLab (Supervised by Dr. Shawn Graham). 
The first phase of research is funded under University of Toronto's CRANE project(Computational Research on the Ancient Near East).

The DOMUS project is a means of creating digital recreations of ancient urban buildings, intended to be a uniform collection of sized wall blocks, each featuring a single building feature such as doors, windows, and balconies, interspersed with blank walls with different trims and textures. These are intended to be created through referencing architectural and archaeological data, primarily photographs and field drawings. The initial pack was created in the Blender 3D engine.

The initial pack was created through a set of photographs taken during Noah Chapman's field expeditions to Pompeii and Ostia Antica. He took photos and rough measurements for the scale of the buildings. The initial phase of the pack focused on domestic buildings. The inital pack focuses on basic doors, windows, walls, and columns, each with a fixed scale intended to be easily fitted and joined together. The "basic wall" is scaled at 9 x 1.85 x 10 Feet. Cross-referencing this with the observations at Pompeii, we are reasonably confident that this will yield properly-scaled buildings.
